=======================================

This is a copy of jaspersoft/jrs-rest-php-client with small enhancements.

Requirements
-------------
![Packagist PHP Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dependency-v/sigedi/jasper-rest-client/php)

Installation
-------------
Run `composer require sigedi/jasper-rest-client` or add the following to your composer.json file:

    {
	    "require": {
		    "sigedi/jasper-rest-client": "*"
	    }
    }


Security Notice
----------------
This package uses BASIC authentication to identify itself with the server. This package should only be used over a trusted connection between your report server and your web server.
